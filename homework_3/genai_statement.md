## Generative AI Statement
1. In this assignment, I used Generative AI validate my MapReduce function structures, explain the SVM function and the methodology of the model, and transfer the code from my local machine to the EC2 instance (which ultimately did not end up working).
2. I used OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4) via the OpenAI web interface.
3. Here are some examples of prompts used in this assignment:
  - Does this MapReduce logic correctly use Mapping and Reducing functions to compute the TF-IDF components?
  - Can you explain what exactly the SVM function is solving for?
  - How can I configure Pyspark sessions to successfully load large csv files on my EC2 instance?
